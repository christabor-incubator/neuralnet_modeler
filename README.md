# A neural network visual modeling tool

## TODO:
* firing threshold visualization
* sum of weights on each layer visualization
* Allow toggling active/inactive
* allow have run simulation
* validator for indivudal weights
* validator for threshold firing (must be >= sum of weights for layer)
* bounding box fugly
* margins on svg
* svg resizing betterment
* consider sum if node is active
* subdue edge if node is active
* validator for final layer having only one node
* have an "answer" or something for output of final node
